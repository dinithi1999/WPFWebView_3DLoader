# WPFWebView_3DLoader

**WPFWebView_3DLoader** is a .NET WPF application that integrates 3D model visualization using **Babylon.js**, embedded inside a **WebView2** control. This application allows for loading and displaying 3D models (such as STL files) in a desktop application with the help of web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and Babylon.js.

## Features
- Load and display 3D models in a WPF desktop application.
- Uses **Babylon.js** for rendering 3D models.
- Embeds the model viewer in a **WebView2** control.
- Supports **STL** file format for 3D model visualization.
- Serves static files locally to avoid CORS issues and ensures full control over file access.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **.NET Core SDK** (Recommended version: 5.0 or later).
- **Python 3.x** (for running the local server to serve static files).
- **NuGet** package `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` (for WebView2 control in WPF).

## Why Babylon.js?
Babylon.js is a powerful, open-source 3D engine that runs within web browsers and leverages **WebGL** for rendering. It is a great solution for handling complex 3D models, animations, and physics, while providing developers with an extensive API. In this project, **Babylon.js** is used to render 3D models inside a **WebView2** control for integration with a WPF desktop application.

### Why use WebView2?
**WebView2** allows embedding web content in a native Windows application. By using **WebView2**, we can leverage modern web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, WebGL) alongside desktop technologies like WPF, providing flexibility and ease of integration. In this application, **WebView2** is responsible for rendering the 3D models using **Babylon.js**.

### Why serve files locally?
We serve files locally through an **HTTP server** to avoid **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. This ensures that **Babylon.js** can load the necessary assets (like 3D models and JavaScript files) without restrictions, providing a more controlled and stable environment for 3D rendering.
